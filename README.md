Full Ecommerce Wesbite using Node.js Express, Xampp (MySQL, Apache).

Attempted to imitated a real-life brand as much as possible, creating a vision, (privacy policy/terms & conditions), developer page.

Almost all functions work, buttons have a purpose, links do redirect to correct sites.

What I Learned: 
Group cooperation using GIT (push/pull)
Backend Features including log in and cart features.
Google Maps API
Full stripe payment implementation
Dynamic javascript features
Brand Logo/Color schemes
Website layout design/feature implementation
Picutre zoom-in feature
Dynamic shopping cart update


I wanted to create a website that simulates what an actual business will build. Our group decided on 'selling' A.I. art to customers. They can add to cart or 'buy now', leading to a dev stripe payment page. We established
our own motivations, visions, reasons why we created the pieces that we made. The first 'full stack' website I have created, previously only attempted static websites. A variety of creative features that goes well into
any website whatsoever. 

Improvements:
Separate CSS files relating to theme.
One html file of products (each individual product has one html file/as dev scales, web loading time would increase)
Fixed roles for developers
Consistent use of IDs
